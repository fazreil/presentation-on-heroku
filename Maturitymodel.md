# **DevSecOps**

- DevSecOps is a cultural change in the software industry aimed at ensuring safety in the rapid-release cycles typical of modern application development and deployment which is DevOps.

- DevSecOps starts the security aspect of application and infrastructure from the beginning of the project.

- Automating security gates to maintain the DevOps workflow.

**DevSecOps Approaches:**

1. Code analysis
  - deliver code in small chunks so vulnerabilities can be identified quickly.

2. Change management
  - increase speed and efficiency by allowing anyone to submit changes, then determine whether the change is good or bad.
3. Compliance monitoring
  - be ready for an audit at any time (which means being in a constant state of compliance, including gathering evidence of GDPR compliance, PCI compliance, etc.).
4. Threat investigation
  - identify potential emerging threats with each code update and be able to respond quickly.
5. Vulnerability assessment
  - identify new vulnerabilities with code analysis, then analyze how quickly they are being responded to and patched.
6. Security training
  - train software and IT engineers with guidelines for set routines.

**Type of software security testing**

1. Static Application Security Testing (SATS)
3. Origin Analysis / Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
8. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
1. Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
1. Test Coverage Analyzes
1. Correlation Tools
1. Database Security Scanning

## **OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model**

-  It is a guidelines to enable the organizations which progress in DevOps journey, to have a faster release cycles and digital innovation demands a strong pitch. Organizations will have to implement DevSecOps in all the application development stages.

**There are four levels of DevSecOps Maturity Model to assess from different dimensions:**
- Level 1: Basic Understanding of security practices
- Level 2: Adoption of basic security practices
- Level 3: High Adoption of basic security practices
- Level 4: Advanced deployment of security practices at scale

**Dimensions**

- This model define steps in reaching more automation to check security aspects.
- To define a roadmap of how projects to achieve certain level of automation to check security aspects during the CI (Continuous Integration) build chain.

**Axes of the Security DevOps maturity model**

- Dynamic Depth:
  - How deep are dynamic scans executed within a Security DevOps CI chain?

- Static Depth:
  - How deep is static code analysis performed within a Security DevOps CI chain?

- Intensity:
  - How intense are the majority of the executed attacks within a Security DevOps CI chain?

- Consolidation:
  - How complete is the process of handling findings within a Security DevOps CI chain?


|Axes| Level 1| Level 2| Level 3| Level 4|
|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
|Dynamic Depth|Scanning of public attack surface| Scanning of authenticated parts through UI layer |Separate scanning of different application layers / backends| argeted scanning of individual forms / wizards (UI) and service layers|
|Static Depth| Assurance that no third-party code with known vulnerabilities is used<br/> - check server-site and client site dependencies | Axis "Static Depth": Level 2Scan important parts of source code for vulnerability patterns  | Scan the complete applicationsâ€™ source code for vulnerability patterns  |   Scan code of (important) third-party dependencies used in application  |
|Intensity|- Dynamic checks: Only passive scanning <br/> -Static checks: Just scan the code along with other code metrics     |   Static checks: Just scan the code along with other code metrics  |   Use heavyweight scanning options on important parts of application    |   Axis "Intensity": Level 4Use customised rule sets for dynamic checks    |
|Consolidation|-Generate human-readable (HTML) reports from tools and link them in Jenkins<br/>-Use simple criteria to "break the build" on heavy findings      |  Custom logic to make build unstable and/or broken depending on<br/> - type of vulnerability<br/>- Confidence level<br/>- Severity ranking  |  Define consolidation goals     | Measure the concrete code coverage of your security testing activities        |
