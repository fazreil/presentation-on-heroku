# Methodology to access infrastructure

# **Hardening**

- a collection of tools and techniques to reduce vulnerability in the infrastructure or the systems unlike test maturity model is emphasizing on the automation process
- provides different protection layers
  - host level
  - application level
  - operating system level
  - user level to physical level

---

# Methodology

**Methodology to assess software development tool security are such as below:**
- **NIST framework**
- **NICE framework**
- **SAST vs DAST**

---

## NIST framework

<NIST
  title="NIST Cybersecurity Framework"/>
---

## NICE Framework

## SAST vs DAST

| SAST | DAST|
|-------------------|------------------|
|White box security testing <br/>:white_flower:access the underlying framework <br/>:white_flower:application tested from inside out <br/>:white_flower:testing represent developer approach| Black box security testing<br/>:white_flower:no knowledge of the framework or technologies <br/>:white_flower:tested from outside in <br/>:white_flower:testing represent hacker approach|

---

|SAST |DAST|
|-------------------|------------------------------|
|:heavy_check_mark: Requires source code|:heavy_check_mark: Requires a running application  |
|:heavy_check_mark:Find vulnerabilities earlier in SDLC |:heavy_check_mark:Find vulnerabilities toward the end of SDLC|
|:heavy_check_mark:Less expensive | :heavy_check_mark:More expensive to solve the vulnerabilities |
|:heavy_check_mark:can't discover run-time and environment-related issues by scanning static code|:heavy_check_mark: Can discover run-time and environment-related issues by using dynamic analysis|
|:heavy_check_mark:Support all kinds of software |:heavy_check_mark: Typically scan only application like web services and web application|

## OWASP DevSecOps Maturity model

- a guidelines to enable the organizations which progress in DevOps journey, to have a faster release cycles and digital innovation demands a strong pitch.

In order to achieve level 4, we should include:

- security SME
- Mutual testing
- Threat modeling
- Building and testing of artifacts in virtual environment
- Handover of confidential parameters
- Usage of a short maximum lifetime for images
- Visualization of logging
- Two factor authentication
- Chaos monkey
- Visualization of metrics
- Coverage of service to service communication
- Smoke testing
- Load test
- Check for malware
- Test cluster deployment resources

---
## **Recommendation**

-  Visualize logfile in real time (e.g. Kibana, SolarWind)
- Check that there are no missing paths in the application with coverage-tools (e.g. Cobertura)
- Implement Smoke testing by Automation
  - *This can verify whether the major functionalities still operates properly.
If the test fails, then they can correct the build and redeploy the build immediately.*
- Use Anchore to analyze the container image and vulnerabilities
- Use Kubesec to perform deployment check
    - *check whether proper security policies take place*
