# **Selected Method**
## **Hardening**

System hardening is a collection of tools and techniques to reduce vulnerability in the infrastructure or the systems unlike test maturity model is emphasizing on the automation process.As the default configuration of the system or application are not set to a highly secure, but more on the usability.
<br>Therefore, hardening is more suitable apply in the system to ensure the assets are secured.
As hardening provides protection layers from host level, application level, operating system level, user level to physical level. This would help the organization to achieve secure application by following the guidance. By implementing hardening, it will reduce holes security while improving the performance. However, test maturity model only focus on performance of the system.

**Hardening**

| Pros | Cons|
|-------------|-----------------|
|Reducing attack surfaces and improving security |an operator, with a limited budget, must decide which entities to harden, which in turn would minimize the damage|
|Improve performance <br> - remove unnecessary services||
|Save money in the long run <br> -hardened server has fewer security incidents||


**Test Maturity Model**

| Pros | Cons|
|-------------|-----------------|
| Effective and measurable tools for test improvements|helps if it is put into place early in the software development process <br> -It cannot be used as an emergency method of recovering from a difficult position|
| detect errors in the production phase|
|Improved customer satisfaction|
|A better understanding of overheads related to testing4|
