# Appendix

### Containerization

- Containerization is virtualization technology that abstracts the Operating System from it's architecture.
- Containerization enable better deployment certainty where the container image will behave identically.
- With Containerization, rollbacks are achievable by redeploying the previous version of the image.

---

### NodeJS

- NodeJS provides a lot of frameworks to be used by developers to create various kind of applications.
- In this project, each UIP Candidates are required to form presentation using MDX-Deck.
- MDX-Deck translates markdown into presentations, deployable as Node Server.

---

### Maven

- Maven is a tool to manage lifecycle of java projects.
- By using maven, developers are exposed to various plugins that empower them to develop robust applications.
